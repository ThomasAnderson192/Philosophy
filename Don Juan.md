## Musikkens Forførelse




## Kierkegaard

Naar Havet bevæger sig oprørt, da danne i denne 
Uro de skummende Bølger Billeder, ligesom Væsener; 
det er som om det var disse Væsener, der satte 
Bølgerne i Bevægelse, og dog er det omvendt 
Bølgegangen, der danner dem. Saaledes er 
Don Juan et Billede, der bestandigt kommer 
til syne, men ikke vinder Skikkelse og Consistens, 
et Individ, der bestandig dannes, men ikke bliver 
færdigt, hvis Historie man intet Andet fornemmer om, 
end ved at lytte til Bølgernes Larmen.

Denne prægnante passage er inspirationskilden
til en moderne Don Juan-fortolkning med 
Inger Christensens sublime roman Azorno (1967).

## Kafka

To the sea, a ceaseless restlessness befalls, 
as if the very turbulence births phantasmal 
specters in the frothy undulations. It is as 
though these apparitions, these ethereal beings, 
invoke the tempestuous tides into their perpetual 
dance. But in truth, it is the tumultuous waves 
that sculpt these elusive phantasms, as if the 
fluid motions birth the enigmatic shapes.

Thus, Don Juan emerges as a recurrent specter, 
an elusive visage that never solidifies, an entity 
in ceaseless formation but never attaining completeness. 
His narrative, a tale one can only fathom by attuning 
to the relentless cacophony of the surging waves, 
an eternal and unfinished opus whispered by the roaring sea.


## The French man

Franz Kafka's writing style is often described as dense, 
dreamlike, and a little prophetic, which is reflected in 
his unique and highly influential literary approach. 
Here's a breakdown of these characteristics:

Dense: Kafka's prose is known for its density. He often uses long, 
intricate sentences that can be challenging to parse. This density 
contributes to a sense of unease and complexity in his works. 
Readers may need to carefully unravel the layers of meaning within his sentences.

Dreaming: Kafka's writing frequently takes on a dreamlike quality. 
His narratives often blur the line between reality and the surreal. 
He conveys a sense of disorientation and unreality, making it difficult 
for readers to distinguish between dream and waking life. This dreamlike 
quality adds to the sense of dislocation and alienation experienced by his characters.

Prophetic: Kafka's writing often feels prophetic in the sense that it 
anticipates or foretells the anxieties and absurdities of the modern world. 
His works touch on themes like bureaucracy, existential dread, and the 
dehumanizing aspects of society, which continue to resonate with readers 
and are seen as prophetic in their insight into the human condition.

Prayer-like: There is a spiritual or prayer-like quality to Kafka's writing, 
especially in how he explores existential themes and the absurdity of life. 
His characters often grapple with metaphysical questions, and the narrative 
tone can sometimes feel like a supplication or an exploration of the divine 
or the unknowable.
